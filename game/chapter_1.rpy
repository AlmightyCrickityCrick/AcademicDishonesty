    "My heart beat fast as I climbed over the windowsill on the first floor 
    and dropped onto the floor."
    
    "The darkness of the night clouded my movement for now, 
    but the longer this breaking and entering plan took, the more chances were that I 
    would be caught."

    "After the disaster of an exam, I went back to my room and worked on the plan. It 
    seemed easy enough in its concept."

    "Wait for the night. Find that one window on the first floor that no one can close. 
    Get into uni. Find professor Bostan’s cabinet. Leave."

    "However, as I gazed around the room, I could feel a slight panic rise in me. This was 
    madness. How was I going to even do this? "

    "Here I was standing inside the university, at night, with nothing but my phone, keys, 
    and some flashlight and rope that I picked for God knows why, hoping to break into a cabinet 
    to replace a test sheet."

    "If my family ever learned about this, my mom would have a heart attack and my dad would disown me. 
    Even grandma would be ashamed… Actually, no, grandma would cheer me on, probably. She always did have 
    a bone to pick with authorities."

    "So, no more hesitating. If I did end up taken by the police after this, I had to at least make her proud. 
    Or at least proud enough to get invited to family dinner…"

    "I took a deep breath. No more thinking about grandma."

    "First things first, I had to calm down and start looking around the university. I was already past the point of 
    no return. If I wanted to sob my eyes out and play the middle school freshman I could have just stayed home and saved 
    myself the trouble."

            "Time to put on my big college student pants. If I wanted to find his cabinet, I had to leave this room and actually 
            move through the building to locate it."

            "So, without waiting for another minute, I held my head high, moved my bag to a more comfortable position, and walked 
            straight out of the door."
